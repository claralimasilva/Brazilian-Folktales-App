          "content": "Once upon a time, deep in the forests of Brazil, there lived a strange little creature named Saci. He had only one leg, wore a red magical cap, and always smoked a small pipe. Saci was fast like the wind and loved to play tricks on people.\nHe tied knots in horses' manes, stole kitchen salt, and hid children's toys. People in the village were always confused. “Who took my boots?” one man asked. “Where is my hat?” cried another. The answer was always the same: “It must be Saci!”\nBut no one had ever seen him—only the little red tornado that appeared and disappeared.\n",

His grandmother told him, “To catch a Saci, you must take his red cap!”\n\nPedro walked quietly and waited near a big tree. Then, he saw the red tornado spinning! With quick hands, Pedro threw the sieve in the air—and the Saci fell into the jar!\n\nThe Saci looked angry. “Let me go!” he said. Pedro smiled. “Not until I learn your secrets.”\n",

He opened the jar. Saci jumped out, did a flip in the air, and disappeared into a red swirl. From that day, Pedro never forgot to care for the forest.\n",
